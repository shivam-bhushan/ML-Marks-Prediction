<h1>ML-Marks-Prediction</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

This project uses machine learning libraries to train a model that predicts the final grade of students according to G1, G2, study time, failures, absence. The model I have trained gives an accuracy of about 92%.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

If you want to train the model yourself, remove the comment tags from the middle of the script and run it. Number of interations can be changed. I have used 30 ittirations but larger numbers won't really affect the runtime.
